\xsummary{
\textbf{TODO}

Advances in modeling and simulation, as well as in hardware and user interface technology have made it possible to develop real-time, immersive, bimanual surgical simulators of unprecedented visual and haptic fidelity. This next generation of surgical simulators promises to enable highly realistic manipulation of soft tissue, dissection, suturing, and accurate instrument-tissue interactions in compelling life-sized virtual environments. With the advent of minimally-invasive robotic surgical instruments, such simulators can play an important role in training medical students and non-specialists in the use of modern surgical robots without the expense and logistical difficulties associated with direct robot training. They can also play a key role in pre-operative procedure planning.

In this project, we propose to develop, deploy, and evaluate a new robotic surgery procedure simulator with high-fidelity force feedback, more realistic tissue mechanics models, and a more versatile geometric interaction environment than has been possible hitherto. We will demonstrate the simulator on the urethral transaction in a radical prostatectomy procedure, a procedure involving complex anatomy, nonlinear tissue mechanics, and dynamic contact between deforming organs. We also propose integrating our simulator with an immersive environment, and evaluating it at Hamad Medical Corporation.}
