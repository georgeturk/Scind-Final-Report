\begin{description}[itemsep=1em]
  \item [Abdulla AlAnsari] Co-Lead PI at HMC, has led the team effort inside Qatar. He has supported and guided the overall research, especially the clinical related activities at HMC. He has been actively involved in facilitating activities between different HMC departments. He closely follows-up all project tasks. In particular, he has worked more closely on Aim 5 and 6.
  \item [AbdulRahman AlFayad] worked closely on Aim 1, 4 and 6, mainly development for improving the prototype integration, modeling, and validation. He also worked on the Sofa testing and validations in Aim 2 and 4.
  \item [Ahammed Waseem Palliyali] worked closely on Aim 1, 4 and 6, mainly development for improving the prototype integration, modeling, and validations
  \item [Dinesh Manocha] PI at UNC, participated in all project meetings, and although he contributes to most project tasks, his work focuses on Aim 3. He is supervising an RA and has worked closely on Aim 1, 3, 4 and 5.
  \item [Georges Younes] coordinates the software development efforts. He was mainly focused on Aim 1 and 4, while contributing to all the other aims.
  \item [George Turkkiyyah] Lead-PI at AUB, coordinated research activities between AUB and its partners in Qatar. He has led the team effort at AUB, primarily concerned with the development of discontinuous finite element formulations for tissue cutting, and overall development of the project. He is supervising an RA and has contributed in all project tasks, and more specifically on Aim 1, 2, 4, and 5.
