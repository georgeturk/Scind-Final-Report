  abstract      = {Multiresolution representations are widely used in many visualization contexts and applications, since they provide optimal management of the data representation by using at each time instant a level of detail most appropriate for the application requirements. Unfortunately, current solutions do not allow the topology of the object to be changed, and this tends to prevent its adoption in applications where topological changes are needed, such as virtual surgery applications. By extending a known multiresolution model based on simplicial complexes, we develop a new approach which supports dynamic topological modifications of the represented object without greatly increasing the representation complexity.}

  abstract      = {As a safe and feasible alternative to enriching and enhancing traditional surgical training, virtual-reality-based surgical simulators have been investigated for a long time. But it is still a challenge for researchers to accurately depict the behavior of human tissue without losing the flexibility of simulation. In this paper, we propose an improved scheme of an interactive finite element model for simulating the surgical process of organ deformation, cutting, dragging, and poking, which can maximally compromise the flexibility and reality of soft-tissue models. The scheme is based on our hybrid condensed finite element model for surgical simulation, which consists of the operational region and nonoperational region. Different optimizing methods applied to these regions make a contribution to the speedup of the calculation. Considering in a real surgical operation, dragging or poking operations are also necessary for surgeons to examine surrounding tissues of the pathological focus. The calculation within the area newly applied with forces in the nonoperational region is handled in our new scheme. The algorithm is modified accordingly in order to cope with this aspect. The design and implementation of the approach are presented. Finally, we provide two models to test our scheme. The results are analyzed and discussed to show the efficiency of our scheme.}

  abstract      = {Although careful planning of surgical approach is a key for success of surgery, conventional planning and simulation tools cannot support detailed discussion. This issue is derived from the difficulty of estimating complex physical behavior of soft tissues provided by a series of surgical procedures like cutting and deformation. This paper proposes an adaptive physics-based framework that simulates both interactive cutting and accurate deformation on virtual bodies, and performs preoperative planning for supporting strategic discussion. We focus on limited use of the two models: A particle-based model and an FEM-based model considering required quality and performance in different situations. FEM-based deformation of incision accurately produces estimated surgical fields. Based on the framework, a strategic planning system was developed for supporting decision of surgical approach using 3D representation of the surgical fields. We applied clinical CT dataset of an aortic aneurysm case to the system. Some experiments and usability tests confirmed that the system contributes to grasping 3D shape and location of the target organs and performs detailed discussion on patient-specific surgical approaches.}

These are sufficient to robustly represent cuts in the mechanical simulation mesh. A high-resolution surface embedded into the octree is employed to represent a cut visually. Model modification is performed in the rest state of the object, which is accomplished by back-transformation of the blade geometry. This results in an improved robustness of our approach. Further, an efficient update of the correspondences between simulation elements and surface vertices is proposed. The robustness and efficiency of our approach is underlined in test examples as well as by integrating it into a prototype surgical simulator.}

  abstract      = {Composite finite elements (CFEs) based on a hexahedral discretization of the simulation domain have recently shown their effectiveness in physically based simulation of deformable bodies with changing topology. In this paper we present an efficient collision detection method for CFE simulation of cuts. Our method exploits the specific characteristics of CFEs, i.e., the fact that the number of simulation degrees of freedom is significantly reduced. We show that this feature not only leads to a faster deformation simulation, but also enables a faster collision detection. To address the non-conforming properties of geometric composition and hexahedral discretization, we propose a topology-aware interpolation approach for the computation of penetration depth. We show that this approach leads to accurate collision detection on complex boundaries. Our results demonstrate that by using our method cutting on high-resolution deformable bodies including collision detection and response can be performed at interactive rates.}

To support such features, we combine a new remeshing algorithm with a fast finite element approach. The proposed method is generic enough to support a large variety of applications.

  abstract      = {Surgical simulators need to simulate deformation and cutting of deformable objects. Adaptive octree mesh based cutting methods embed the deformable objects into octree meshes that are recursively refined near the cutting tool trajectory. Deformation is only applied to the octree meshes; thus the deformation instability problem caused by degenerated elements is avoided. Biological tissues and organs usually contain complex internal structures that are ignored by previous work. In this paper the deformable objects are modeled as voxels connected by links and embedded inside adaptive octree meshes. Links swept by the cutting tool are disconnected and object surface meshes are reconstructed from disconnected links. Two novel methods for embedding triangular meshes as internal structures are proposed. The surface mesh embedding method is applicable to arbitrary triangular meshes, but these meshes have no physical properties. The material sub-region embedding method associates the interiors enclosed by the triangular meshes with physical properties, but requires that these meshes are watertight, and have no self-intersections, and their smallest features are larger than a voxel. Some local features are constructed in a pre-calculation stage to increase simulation performance. Simulation tests show that our methods can cut embedded structures in a way consistent with the cutting of the deformable objects. Cut fragments can also deform correctly along with the deformable objects.}

  abstract      = {This paper proposed an improved point based method to simulate the deformation and cutting of cornea, realized the real-time interaction between the force feedback device and the model in virtual surgery. We construct a hybrid deformable model, the model consists of two parts: the interior of the cornea consists of some particles, and the boundary consists of some meshes which are formed by surfaces nodes, calculate the stress tensor of particle can simulate corneal deformation. In this process, in order to ensure the stability of the deformation, a volume constraint is added to our model. By sampling on the surface of the model to form some meshes, the model could support the changes of topology. Using a node replication method for surface cutting and subdivide the cutting triangles in the cutting process, so that it can generate relatively smooth incision. Experiments show that the model provides a real and efficient deformation simulation, with good stability and scalability.}
