\section{Geometric Algorithms for Continuous Collision Detection}\label{sec:continuous_collision}

\subsection{Collision Detection}\label{ssec:collision_detection}
A key challenge is to develop new collision detection algorithms that can be used to check for contacts between deforming objects. One of the issues is to develop scheme that can handle topology changes that are induced by operations such as cutting and suturing. We have been working new techniques to compute the first time of contact between the models using novel continuous collision detection algorithms. Not only do they check for collisions between different objects (e.g.\ organ and the instruments), but they also perform self-collisions between each organ. We dynamically divide the models into clusters that are guaranteed to be non self-colliding. That way, the problem is reduced to checking for collisions between different clusters. The key issue in computing such clusters is to ensure to minimize the number of such clusters during each step of the simulation. We are currently finishing the first prototype implementation and hope to test its performance on the organ benchmarks. The initial testing is performed on a single core CPU, but later we would parallelize them to many-core GPUs. These collision algorithms would be integrated with the finite-element solvers as part of the robust surgical simulation system.

\subsection{Fast Continuous Collision Processing}\label{ssec:fast_ccd}
We have been developing new algorithms for deformable collision detection using hierarchical representations. These include recomputing a new hierarchy based on the mesh topology, traversing the hierarchy and checking for overlaps, and finally between elementary tests for continuous collision detection between the triangle primitives. The continuous collision checks are performed to compute any overlaps between two discrete instances. In order to deal with the topological changes in the mesh caused by cutting operation, we keep track of the changes in mesh connectivity and the new triangles that are added or deleted between successive frames. Our work exploits the local nature of these mesh connectivity changes and performs selective update of the mesh hierarchy that is governed by these incremental changes. In order to perform the selective updates, we use a novel dynamic clustering scheme. Our clustering scheme quickly decomposes the boundary of the objects into non self-colliding clusters based on the meshconnectivity and topology information. This dynamic clustering strategy is general, efficient and involves no precomputation and exploits the high coherence in the simulation results between successive frames of the mesh. Furthermore, we use a merging algorithm that tends to compute tighter-fitting BVH (bounding volume hierarchy). Such tighter hierarchy reduces the number of false positives during the traversal and ultimately reduces the number of elementary tests between the triangle primitives corresponding to the continuous collision checking results. The cluster hierarchy is used to dynamically compute the new BVH using a lazy approach governed by the mesh topology changes.

We assume that we are given a scene composed of one or more objects. Typically each joint organ used in the surgical simulator represents a separately object and is given as a mesh. Each object is represented as a triangle mesh and may correspond to an open or closed object. We assume that it is possible to perform a local inside/outside classification with respect to each triangle in the mesh and that each triangle normal is pointing outward. During the FEM simulation, the objects may undergo motion or deformations, which can change their topology or generate new vertices and triangles; while the connectivity information may change, we assume that the new set of objects are still represented as triangular meshes with local inside/outside classification. Given two discrete time instances in a simulation, we assume that the vertices of the objects move at a constant velocity during that time interval. If new vertices are generated due to topology changes, the CCD (continuous collision checking) problem is then posed as a problem of defining appropriate mapping between the two discreteinstances. Our goal is to check whether there is any collision, including self-collisions, during that time interval, which we represent as $t \in [0, 1]$. For two triangles, this computation reduces to performing 15 elementary tests corresponding to vertex-face (VF) and edge-edge (EE) pairs. Given a CCD query, we assume that there are no collisions among the primitives at $t = 0$. This assumption can be easily checked by using a discrete collision detection algorithm and using the simple BVH.

The simplest general algorithms for CCD between models undergoing topological changes (due to the cutting operation) are based on computing a BVH of all the objects in the scene. The leaf nodes of the BVH correspond to the triangle primitives and the intermediate nodes correspond to the bounding volumes (e.g.\ k-DOPs). Prior CCD algorithms traverse the BVH and perform the CCD queries between the overlapping primitives. Since the connectivity information in the mesh changes when the topology changes, prior techniques that used connectivity information to reduce the number of elementary tests are not directly applicable. As a result, prior algorithms would need to recompute the BVH for the entire scene using top-down or bottom-up manner, which can become expensive for complex scenes with a lot of objects. In order to speed this CCD computation, we decompose the object boundaries into dynamic clusters. Our approach usesa new dynamic clustering scheme. It generates the clusters in an incremental manner by traversing the triangles on the mesh boundary, and makes no assumptions about topology or connectivity changes. We denote these clusters as leaf clusters, which correspond to the lowest level of clusters (or leaf clusters) in the final cluster hierarchy. Moreover, we ensure that each cluster has no self-collisions among its triangle primitives. As a result, CCD reduces to querying only for inter-cluster collisions.

There are two key issues that arise in terms of computing such leaf clusters. The first issue is that, while we want to decompose the boundary into as few clusters as possible, the problem of computing that minimal number of clusters based on some standard criterion (e.g.\ convexity) tends to be NP-hard. To overcome this issue, we compute these clusters using a greedy strategy that exploits the local connectivity and mesh changes. The second issue is that the clusters must be computed efficiently during each frame, as the objectâ€™s topology may change from frame to frame. Our next step is to merge these leaf clusters to generate the intermediate clusters; each of these intermediate clusters is also guaranteed to have no self-collisions. Our algorithm merges variousneighboring leaf clusters, while the merged cluster preserve the no self-collision property. The upper level of the hierarchy are obtained by combining various intermediate clusters in a bottom-up manner. At runtime, we traverse the tree in a top down manner and check such cluster bounding volumes for collisions between them using their bounding boxes.

We have finished a preliminary implementation of this algorithm and tested its correctness on simple benchmarks. In the next six months, we propose to integrate them with the outputs of the FEM simulator that are used to implement the cutting operation.

\subsection{Volume Mesh}\label{ssec:volume_mesh}
We are currently considering cutting human tissue open. When the human tissue is not cut, it is a volume and we can represent it as a watertight mesh and represent the internal materials as a discrete set of elements. When the tissue is cut, what we can do is to extend the surface mesh into the cut and stills make the mesh watertight. Our CD algorithm assumes that the mesh is always watertight. This assumption can be implemented using a remeshing tool.

\subsection{KDOP}\label{ssec:kdop}
In order to make CD faster, we do not directly check collision between every pair of n elements (this is $\mathrm{O}(n^2)$).  Therefore, we first use a simple geometry, e.g.\ a box, to bound a set of fine-detailed tissues and check whether these simple geometry collides, if not we do not need costly fine-detailed CD checks. These fine-detailed geometry cannot be too simple, they should represent the fine-detailed tissues reasonably well, KDOPs does this job better than boxes.

\subsection{Front Tracking}\label{ssec:front_tracking}
Front tracking means that between timesteps, your human tissues does not change alot. So that we do not perform CD checks from scratch at each iteration. Instead, we keep track of what's in collision during last timestep and go from there. This makes things faster.

\subsection{Energy-based Collision Response}\label{ssec:energy_based_response}
This is a method where we allow some degrees of collision to remain at every timestep, i.e.\ we do not guarantee collisions are clearly up between timesteps. Instead, we provide a function that grows larger when you have more and deeper penetrations (collisions). Therefore, you can somewhat minimize collisions by minimizing our function.

\subsection{CCD vs.\ DCD}\label{ssec:ccd_vs_dcd}
These are two modes of CD checks. CCD works in continuous time and check whether the movement between two timesteps will cause collision. If so, resolve these collisions and do it until no collisions are remaining. DCD works in discrete time and check wheter the state of mesh at each time instance will cause collision. It does not guarantee collision-free state but runs much faster.

\subsection{Progress during the last six months}
During the past period, we have updated the collision detector (algorithm and routines) to support various detection queries. These queries are needed at different stages of blade and human tissue interactions, which are part of surgical simulation. When the tip of the blade is moving along a prescribed trajectory, our detector performs continuous collision detection (CCD) to check for collisions between the trajectory of the tip and the mesh faces (trajectory/face detection). At the same time, we also performs continuous collision detection between the body of the blade and the mesh edges (body/edge detection). These two detections are used to update the topology of a mesh stored using half-edge data structure.

Besides collision detection, we have also updated the detector to support dynamic boundary volume hierarchy update after the topology of mesh has changed. This involves keeping track of each addition/deletion of edge/face/vertex in the half-edge mesh. On each modification, we update the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) to add/delete the corresponding node of the hierarchy and make sure that the hierarchy is of high quality and well-balanced so that further queries can be answered efficiently.

Finally, we have setup some standard test routines to make sure the detector works properly. This is done by using a set of standard mesh cuts and perform parity check between the BVH data structure and the half-edge mesh after each cut. A sample animation video is available at \url{https://www.dropbox.com/s/6m4t7kwle8dp1kt/demo.mp4}.

\subsection{Goals for the next six months}
We want to finish this integration of realtime CCD and FEM. As you can imagine, many non-trivial issues are coming up as we try to integrate these two technologies and still try to get realtime performance. Our next goal is to perform detailed performance analysis and demonstrate the results on complex models. There are very few (or none) systems that have performed such tight integration. However, the best way to demonstrate is to:

\begin{enumerate}[\em i\em)]
  \item Evaluate its performance on complex benchmarks, and
  \item Demonstrate the benefits on realtime surgical simulation scenario.
\end{enumerate}

Ultimately, we want to show the actual benefits to the driving application.

Fast collision detection and processing of the intersection of cutting tools with meshes are key operations in surgical simulation. The primary operation while cutting involves the intersection of the cutting tool trajectory with all volumetric elements of the mesh, not just the edges and faces on the boundary surfaces. As described earlier, these intersections are the starting point of the mesh subdivision operations to produce topological separation in the mesh.

The collisions involved in a cutting event must be continuous collisions where all the intersections along the path of the cutting tool movement should be reported, not just the collisions that happen at the starting and ending time instances. We first transform these continuous collisions into discrete collisions by triangulating the path of the cutting tool movement using triangle strips. After that, we detect all the edge-triangle intersections between the cutting tool path and the volumetric mesh. Note that the triangles involve both surface triangles and internal tetrahedral faces of the volumetric mesh.

Another key geometric processing operation involves the contact between the exposed boundary surface elements of the mesh and a rigid non-cutting surgical tool that can hold or push into the body but only on its exterior surface. Continuous collision detection (CCD) methods are needed to robustly detect these collisions, which of course induce deformations in the volumetric mesh that are computed by the finite element model as described in Aim 2. The collisions involved in a non-cutting event can be detected following a conventional CCD algorithm, which consists of two kinds of events: vertex-triangle intersection and edge-edge intersection.

For both cutting and non-cutting events, we use a unified bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) to perform collision culling, which is essential for the high-performance of a collision detection system. However, most previous works only considered constructing a BVH for a mesh with fixed topology in a precomputation step. Other methods use spatial hashing which can be used for changing topologies but involves more computation than BVH because the spatial hashes of every element have to be updated at every frame.

To combine the merits of these two methods, we use a dynamic BVH data structure. We construct an initial BVH for all the surface as well as internal triangular faces for the volumetric mesh using an existing method, which minimizes the SAH-cost function using a greedy algorithm. When edge or vertex intersection queries are required, we first find faces in BVH and then index into the incident edges and vertices. The choice of only constructing one BVH for faces reduces the computational cost to update the BVH after the vertices move.

  \caption{An illustration of iterative BVH updation. We update the BVH at every timestep by first visiting every node in depth first order, so that when we visit a node for the second time, its children have correct and updated bounding volume. During the second visit of an internal node, it can either has three children (\emph{a}) or four children (\emph{b}) with the next two levels. In the case of (\emph{a}), we check whether letting $C_1,C_3$ be sibling or letting $C_2,C_3$ be sibling will improve SAH cost. If so, we apply the corresponding rotation. In the case of (\emph{b}), we check whether letting $<C_1,C_3>,<C_2,C_4>$ be sibling or letting $<C_1,C_4>,<C_2,C_3>$ be sibling will improve SAH cost. If so, we apply the corresponding rotation. In summary, there are two possible rotations to be considered in both cases.}\label{fig:BVHRotation}

When a topology change happens, the change can be boiled down to two operations: adding new triangular faces and deleting existing triangular faces. When these operations happen, we update our BVH in a brute force manner without performing any tree balancing operations. Specifically, to add a new face, we first search in the BVH for the existing leaf node that is closest to the face, and then use the leaf node as the sibling of the new face node. To delete a face, we use its sibling as its parent node. However, after several topology changes, the BVH will be ill-balances and reconstructing the tree is too computationally costly for a real-time application. To meet the performance requirement, we choose to greedily and iteratively balance the tree. After every frame of the FEM simulation, mesh vertices will move and BVH must be updated accordingly. This update will visit the entire tree in a depth-first manner. When each non-leaf node is visited in this process, we check whether a left-rotation or a right-rotation in the AVL tree balancing algorithm will help reduce the SAH-cost. If so, the operation is applied to the node, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:BVHRotation}. Note that this modification to the BVH update algorithm does not increase the computational complexity, and the complexity of BVH update is still linear in the number of tree nodes. Finally GPGPU implementations are now available, and Aim 4 is continuing integration efforts into the final prototype.
